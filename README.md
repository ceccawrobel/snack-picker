### **Snack Picker**

**description**

This webpage was created for a code review in the Epicodus part-time Intro to Programming course.

This webpage contains a form for helping someone like myself decide what weird snack to eat.

It is somewhat incomplete, and the logic could probably be more neatly organized, but it works and I believe that it fits all requirements for this code review.

**instructions**
1. Answer the questions.
2. Submit the form, and read about some snack ideas!
3. If you are judging this work, the next step is to look at the code.
4. Consider: Does it make sense? Is it easy to look at?
5. If anything doesn't make sense, you can [let me know](mailto:ceccawrobel@gmail.com). You may also keep it to yourself! But I'm not too proud to accept feedback if you feel so inclined.
